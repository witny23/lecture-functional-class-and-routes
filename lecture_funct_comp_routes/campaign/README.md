GOALS

    Understand the differencee between functional components and class components

    functional vs class component comparison:

    when to use functional or component:

    In class components, the render method will be called whenever the state of the components changes.

    On the other hand, the Functional components render the UI based on the props.

    Hooks
        - Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
        - Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
        - Hooks will not work in React class components.
        - W3C React Hooks: https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_hooks.asp
        - W3C React useState Hook: https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_usestate.asp

    W3C React State: https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp

    When first learning - class Components should be preferred whenever we have a requirement with the state of the component.

    More advanced - functional components can implement Hooks to use the state and other React features even without writing the Class Component
